  <strong>Studski</strong>
</h1>
Studski is a platform made to allow students attending Croatian universities to share their learning materials and files they've used in their studies with their colleagues and/or future generations of students. It's main purpose is being a dedicated place for students to find the best learning materials, for their specific university; filtered of any other content, which tends to be the problem when trying to use platforms online not specifically dedicated to this purpose. It also functions as a personal storing system for students that have finished with a particular class but would like to keep helpful materials for future reference.
